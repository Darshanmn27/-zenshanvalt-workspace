## 🔥 Why Am I Doing This? 💯
👉 I believe that **daily coding practice** is the key to becoming a **FAANG-level Software Engineer**.  
👉 By consistently uploading my code here, I can **track my progress** and stay motivated. 🚀💯  

👉 Also, I want to make sure that when any company (like **Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant**) checks my profile,  
they should immediately see my **coding consistency** and know that:  

> **"This Guy Codes Every Day! He Is Consistent, Dedicated, and Highly Skilled!"** 🚀💯

## 💻 How To Track My Coding Progress? 📊
I am planning to build a custom **Coding Progress Tracker Dashboard** using:  
- ✅ React.js (Frontend)  
- ✅ Node.js + MongoDB (Backend)  
- ✅ GitHub API (to pull my daily commits)  

👉 This will generate a **daily heatmap** showing my coding progress. 💯🚀
